This is a minor project on  computing the roots of a quadratic equation. The  drive is to try to solve for the roots of the quadratic
of any form or nature.

As a result , this program can compute the  complex roots of an equation in the complex plane. The project is still to expand.
A GUI Calculator is still under development. The Calculator , where needed , will use this program to solve problems at hand.

I  provided 2 text files , they show samples of the file from which we can read constants and one into which we can write the 
solutions.
